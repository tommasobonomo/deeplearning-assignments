# deeplearning-assignments

Assignments and practicals completed during the Deep Learning course at Eindhoven University of Technology, in collaboration with [@MattiaMolon](https://github.com/MattiaMolon).
Implemented in TensorFlow.

Topics tackled:

- Convolutional Neural Networks:
  - Transfer learning through VGGNet;
  - Metric learning through Siamese Nets and Triplet Networks;
  - Autoencoders and Denoising autoencoders;
- Recurrent Neural Networks:
  - Long-Term Short Memory (LSTM) and Attention;
  - Caption generation for images;
  - Sentiment classification;
- Generative Models:
  - Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for Anomaly Detection.
